## Reporting a bug to Moov

Report security bugs in Moov's open-source code to `security@moov.io`.

Report security bugs in Moov Financial's code or products via [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/moov).

After submitting a report an acknowledged will be received within 5 days and
you can expect a more detailed response after the investigation occurs. Moov
may resolve issues prior to notifying the reporter.

## Reporting a bug in a third party module

Security bugs in third party modules should be reported to their respective
maintainers.

## Disclosure policy

Moov Financial will work with the reporter on disclosure after resolutions are
enacted, but an embargo will be in place for every report. Moov may take additional
time to ensure no customer impact has occurred and systems are secure.
